#Rails-&-JS-Project-Phase-4

My Rails + JavaScript project is a SPA that allows users to create, listen to, delete, and comment on guided meditations.

Install Instructions: Download from https://github.com/kraeman/breathe. Install gems with bundler and run rails db:migrate if necessary. After running command 'rails s' in the backend, cd into the frontend and run 'open index.html'.

Usage: When html opens in browser, agree to share your computer's mic. Click 'Record' to begin recording a meditation and 'Stop' to end recording. Name the recording and click 'ok'. With a recording on the page, you can now interact with it by pressing the play/pause button as well as leave a comment. If you would like, you can delete a meditation.
